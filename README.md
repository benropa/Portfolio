# Ben Ropa Portfolio

## Description
This project provides us with an opportunity to begin showcasing our knowledge of CSS and HTML on a personal webpage. Our aim is to create a porfolio
that displays the work we complete within the bootcamp. Over the next 6 months we will add and update content to this page. Following graduation from the bootcamp, our final product will be a key resource in our job search.
